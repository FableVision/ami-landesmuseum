Various campaigns by the Confederates in the 15th century lead to the conquest of the northern border areas of the Duchy of Milan. It becomes a subject territory of the Confederation. With the Helvetic Republic 1798 Ticino becomes an equal canton."

A similar number to the capacity of the Basel football stadium. This map shows you where the Romanish get spoken. \n\nDue to the former remoteness of many places and valleys, 5 different idioms of Romansch have developed. Some of these language idioms are so different that two Romansh speakers cannot communicate with each other straight away. This is not surprising when you consider that some places are more than 4 hours away from each other when travelling."
